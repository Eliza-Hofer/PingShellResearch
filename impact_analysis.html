	    <h2>Pingshell's Killchain: Infection and Impact</h2>
	    <p>Pingshell alone is just a blob of code that lets a computer recieve more code to run; however, when combined with known packing, social engineering, and post exploitation techniques it becomes much more potent. Below I have listed several techniques that can be combined with pingshell to help it either get onto a target machine, or expand its capabilities.</p>

		    <tr>
			    <td>Github Render Abuse</th>
			    <td>While this is not technically a vulnerability, this technique is a simple way to get maicious code onto another computer with some social engineering involved. Considering the market for cheating tools for games, many people will download and run sketchy code from github. The one way to mitigate this is to ensure to scroll and check if there is any extra code hidden outside the normal viewing area.</td>
			    <td>Packing (hiding malware inside seemingly legitimate code)</td>

		    </tr>
		    <tr>
			    <td>Extension Render Abuse</td>
			    <td>In windows, similarly to github, it is possible to add white space after the name of a file, which can allow for some shenanigans with filetype. For example someone can name a file soemthing innocuous like "Video.mp4" and then put a bunch of "whitespace" afterwards to hide the original file extension. Symptoms of this can be easier to spot, because the application icon will always show the true filetype(unless chained with other techniques like icon manipulation). </td>
			    <td>Packing (hiding malware inside seemingly legitimate code)</td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
			    <td>Polyglotting</td>
			    <td>A polyglot is a valid program written in 2 languages at once. While this has many non-malicious applications, a polyglot can be written to have different results depending on how it is run. Giving the attacker a way of hiding malicous functionality inside a program that seems to be completely normal program, but it can in theory call itself in a different language to trigger the malicious functionality.</td>
			    <td>Packing (hiding malware inside seemingly legitimate code)</td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
			    <td>Icon Manipulation</td>
			    <td>This is a common technique to give a .exe file for a game a different image.However, because you can make it anything you want, you can make it look like a different filetype. This can add to the believeability that the program is what it claims to be.  </td>

			    <td>Trusted Installer Abuse</td>
			    <td><a href="https://www.tiraniddo.dev/2017/08/the-art-of-becoming-trustedinstaller.html">Tryranids Lair</a> This is a "feature" of windows that can be abused to escilate privelages even higher than administraitor. This was originally discovered in 2013 and has been absuable as recently as 8 months ago. This can be used to create new users, access any file, delete all of system32, or anything else your heart desires. </td>
